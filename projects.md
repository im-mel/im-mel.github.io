## Facial Recognition and Teaching Emotional Regulation
Currently, working as a PM/UXR in the A.I.R. (Artificial Intelligence Research) lab at Nanyang Technological University under Professor Yew Soon Ong. Partnering with the Association for Personal Needs and the Ministry of Education, we apply artificial intelligence to improve applications we have launched in the school board to help teachers enrich the learning experience for children who have difficulties with emotional expression and regulation. I am greateful for the opportunity to apply my cognitive neuropsychology background with my interests in user research and the product lifecycle to create a minimum viable product that has tremendous impact on the lives of our users.



## A Dive into Neuroscience and Human Computer Interaction 
Since taking a course in HCI, I have increasingly thought about how to better apply cognitive neuropsychology to the field. There have been many inspirations from various publications that have shaped my views on both domains and have inspired me towards working on my own. With the mentorship of NTU's UX Lab Director Professor Kwan Min Lee, I hope to generate something meaningful in the next few months through lots of brainstorming and secondary research. 



## Snake Bite Prevention and Intervention 
<p><em> "Snake bite is a neglected public health issue in many tropical and subtropical countries. About 5.4 million snake bites occur each year, resulting in 1.8 to 2.7 million cases of envenomings (poisoning from snake bites).There are between 81 410 and 137 880 deaths and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities each year." </em><p> - World Health Organization
  
  Working on collecting user data and research remotely, to improve an application by Newton Technologies aimed at snake bite prevention and intervention through crowdsourcing information. 



## Improving Interfaces to Increase Viable Data Points
Over the summer 2019, I was able to work at the Montreal Neurological Institute as an Undergraduate Researcher in the lab of McConnell Brain Imaging Center Director Dr. Julien Doyon and Université de Montréal's Julie Carrier. During the piloting phase of this neuropsychology experiment, I collected participant data which included cognitive tests, observational studies, EEG data and surveys. Through first hand collection of the data, I was able to provide feedback to software engineers on our team to tweak the user interface of the online tasks, therefore increasing the number of viable data points per session. This experience was extremely engaging and something I found myself to be passionate about, hence igniting my interests in user studies for interfaces and real world applications.
