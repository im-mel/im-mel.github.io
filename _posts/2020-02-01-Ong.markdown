## Background
Currently, working as a researcher in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research (DSAIR) lab at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Director Yew Soon Ong](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/About-A-STAR/corporate-profile/people/professor-ong-yew-soon). Partnering with the Association for Persons with Special Needs (ASPN) and the Ministry of Education, we implement AI based tools such as facial recognition to improve applications tailored for educators to enrich the learning experience for children with special needs who have difficulties with emotional expression and regulation. My role is to complete the user research to improve the UX/UI as well as brainstorm and test new features of the product. 

I am greateful for the opportunity to combine my cognitive neuropsychology background with my interests in user research and the product lifecycle to create a product that has the capacity to greatly impact the lives of our users.

## UX Research Methodologies
- User Personas
- Cognitive Walkthroughs
- Card Sorting 
- Directed and Non-Directed Interviews
- Surveys
- Unmoderated Usability Tests

## Secondary Research
Equally as important as the user research, is my resesarch on the cognitive psychology aspects of child development and emotional learning, particularly in children with special needs. There is no better way incorporate human centric design than to understand the humans themselves - on a neuropsychological level. Some areas of recurring secondary research I focus on for this project include:
- Attention
- Memory
- Learning
- Motivation 
- Reasoning 
- Emotions
