## Cognitive Neuropsychology and HCI

Since taking a course in HCI, I have increasingly thought about how to better apply cognitive neuropsychology to the field. There have been many inspirations from various publications that have shaped my views on both domains and have inspired me towards working on my own. With the mentorship of NTUâ€™s UX Lab Director [Professor Kwan Min Lee](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=kwanminlee), I hope to generate something meaningful in the next few months through lots of brainstorming and secondary research.
