## Background
Starting in Summer 2019 and continuing into the fall semester, I worked at the Montreal Neurological Institute as an Undergraduate Researcher in the lab of McConnell Brain Imaging Center Director Dr. Julien Doyon and Université de Montréal’s Julie Carrier. During the piloting phase of our neuropsychology experiment, I was involved in a range of research roles. I lead participant recruitment by redesigning the recruitment media (one such example can be found below), conducted screening sessions and cognitive assessments. During the data acquisition phase, I collected participant data through means which included but were not limited to: observational studies, electroencephalography/polysomnography and user surveys. 

My most fond achievement during my time with this lab, was being able to increase the number of viable data points per session by providing feedback to the SWEs on our team to enhance accessibility (for our older participants) and usability of the interface design of the online tasks. Facilitating this particular improvement was extremely engaging for me, hence igniting my interests in user studies for interfaces and real world applications.
