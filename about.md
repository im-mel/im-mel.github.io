<p>Greetings! I'm Melissa, or Mel for short. I'm a Bachelor of Arts & Science undergrad at McGill University studying both Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science. As I continue with my degree I learn more and more about the significantly increasing relationship between the two, and hope by doing so I will discover my own role within <em>both</em> domains.</p>

<p> Outside of class, my interests span from mixed doubles Tennis to mixed methods research. Currently, I am working on a fun project related to finding new methodologies in which neuroscience can improve the quality of human computer interaction and vice versa. A little far from home in Singapore, I hope to expand my horizons in the field on this side of the world.</p>
