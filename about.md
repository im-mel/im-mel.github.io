<p>Greetings! I'm Melissa, or Mel for short. I'm a Bachelor of Arts & Science undergrad at McGill University studying both Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science. As I continue with my degree I learn more and more about the significantly increasing relationship between the two, and I hope that by doing so I will discover my own role within <em>both</em> domains.</p>

<p> Outside of class, my interests span anywhere from mixed doubles tennis to mixed methods research. Currently, I am working on a fun project related to finding new methodologies in which cognitive neuropsychology which can improve the quality of human computer interaction and vice versa. A little far from home on exchange in Singapore till the summer, I hope to expand my horizons in the field on this side of the world.</p>

<p> I'm always looking to learn more about UX, HCI, product management or just cool things in general so if you have any blog or book recommendations feel free to drop me a line on any of my socials! </p>
